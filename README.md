-# Getting Started with Create React App
+# Google AI Studio Clone
 
-This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
+This project is a clone of Google AI Studio, built with React. It aims to replicate some of the core functionalities and user interface of the original Google AI Studio.
+
+## Features
+
+*(Add a list of key features your clone implements or plans to implement. For example:)*
+- Feature A: Brief description
+- Feature B: Brief description
+- ...
+
+## Tech Stack
+
+- **Frontend:** React
+- **Styling:** (e.g., CSS Modules, Styled Components, Tailwind CSS - specify what you're using)
+- **State Management:** (e.g., Context API, Redux, Zustand - specify if used)
+- **Build Tool:** Create React App
+
+## Getting Started
+
+To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.
+
+### Prerequisites
+
+Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.
+- npm
+  ```sh
+  npm install npm@latest -g
+  ```
+
+### Installation
+
+1. Clone the repo
+   ```sh
+   git clone https://github.com/your_username/google-ai-studio-clone.git
+   ```
+   *(Replace `your_username/google-ai-studio-clone.git` with your actual repository URL)*
+2. Navigate to the project directory
+   ```sh
+   cd google-ai-studio-clone
+   ```
+3. Install NPM packages
+   ```sh
+   npm install
+   ```
 
 ## Available Scripts
 
 In the project directory, you can run:
 
 ### `npm start`
-
 Runs the app in the development mode.\
 Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
 
 The page will reload if you make edits.\
 You will also see any lint errors in the console.
 
 ### `npm test`
-
 Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
 See the section about running tests for more information.
 
 ### `npm run build`
-
 Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
 It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
 
 The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
 Your app is ready to be deployed!
-
 See the section about deployment for more information.
 
 ### `npm run eject`
-
 **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**
 
 If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
-
 Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.
-
 You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
